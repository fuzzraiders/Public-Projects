### "Precision over chaos. Documentation over guesswork."

This repository contains **public FuzzRaiders projects**: structured practice simulations, tooling, and templates.
These are not random CTF notes — they are **end-to-end offensive workflows** built in **authorized lab environments**, documented in a way that can be reviewed and reproduced.

## ⚡ The Philosophy

Unlike typical walk-throughs, our practice projects mirror real engagement thinking while staying safe to publish:

- **Operational discipline:** Every step has a reason, evidence, and outcome.
- **Technical depth:** We validate findings, demonstrate exploitation safely, and assess impact.
- **Clean documentation:** If it isn’t documented, it didn’t happen.

## 📂 Project Structure

We keep a consistent schema for traceability and review quality.

```text
FR-PR-YYYY-XXX_Project-Name/
├── README.md           # Engagement summary, scope, goals, and attack flow
├── Report/             # Sanitized executive + technical report (PDF/MD)
├── Docs/           # Sanitized outputs, screenshots, and safe PoCs
└── Resources/          # Wordlists, notes, and helper scripts (as applicable)
```

### 🏷️ Naming Convention

| Element  | Meaning                 | Example |
| -------- | ----------------------- | ------- |
| **FR**   | FuzzRaiders Org         | `FR`    |
| **PR**   | Project Type (Practice) | `PR`    |
| **YYYY** | Year of Execution       | `2026`  |
| **XXX**  | Sequential Index        | `001`   |

## 🛠️ The FuzzRaiders Workflow

Every simulation follows a consistent 6-phase lifecycle:

1. **Scope & Recon:** Define boundaries and map the attack surface.
2. **Enumeration:** Systematic discovery of services and weaknesses.
3. **Validation:** Confirm assumptions and prove exploitability.
4. **Exploitation:** Controlled execution of the attack chain (lab-safe).
5. **Post-Exploitation:** Privilege analysis, impact assessment, and data sensitivity.
6. **Review:** Reporting, peer review, and methodology refinement.
